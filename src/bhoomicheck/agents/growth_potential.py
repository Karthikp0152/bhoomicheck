"""Growth Potential Agent: KUDA master-plan extracts -> GrowthPotentialReport.

Deterministic, same pattern as ZoningAgent -- reads the same
KudaMasterPlanExtract, different fields (see schemas/zoning.py
docstring). One real difference from every other specialist agent built
so far: growth potential is informational/upside, not risk. Neither
"in a growth corridor" nor "not in a growth corridor" is a problem, so
these findings only ever use verified_ok/not_verified -- issue_found is
never produced here, because there's nothing to flag as wrong with a
parcel simply having lower growth potential.
