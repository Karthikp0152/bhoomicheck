- One entry in "documents" per attached file; source_document is the filename.
- Every finding needs provenance (source_type "manual", document = the

- If something cannot be read or verified, report it as a finding with
  status "not_verified" — never omit it silently.
- Express extraction uncertainty honestly in extraction_confidence.
