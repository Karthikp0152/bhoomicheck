"""Zoning Agent: KUDA master-plan extracts -> ZoningReport.

Deterministic, same reasoning as LitigationAgent: by the time this runs,
KudaMasterPlanAdapter.parse() has already turned a screenshot into a
structured KudaMasterPlanExtract, so there's no free text left to
interpret -- just a fixed mapping from fields to Findings.

Every finding's confidence explicitly carries the caveat noted in
adapters/kuda.py: the source is 1acre.in's third-party overlay of the
KUDA Master Plan 2041, not an official KUDA-issued certificate. That
caveat has to live here, at the point a Finding is actually created --
noting it in the adapter's docstring alone would be easy to forget by
the time this agent (or a report reader) makes a decision from it.
