    PROVISIONAL -- see adapters/land_records.py module docstring. Every
    field is optional because nobody has supplied a real sample screenshot
    yet; field names/vocabulary are a best-effort guess from public
    knowledge of what the portal shows, not read off a real result.

    Attributes:
        owner_names: Pattadar name(s) on record. A list because Telangana
            records commonly show joint/multiple pattadars for one survey
            number.
        pattadar_passbook_no: The passbook number, if shown.
        extent: Land area as displayed (units vary -- acres-guntas, sq.
            yards -- so this stays free text rather than a parsed float).
        land_type: e.g. "patta land", "assigned land", "government land"
            -- exact vocabulary Bhu Bharati uses is unconfirmed, so this
            stays free text rather than a Literal for now.
        prohibited_status: Whether the parcel is flagged in the
            prohibited-lands (Section 22-A) register -- this is the
            central "assigned/prohibited land" risk from CLAUDE.md's
