        source_document: Filename of the upload this was extracted from —
            the provenance anchor for every field below.
        doc_type: Classification of the document.
        doc_type_detail: Free-text description, required when doc_type is
            "other" so the escape hatch can never be used silently.
        reference_no: Registration number, EC application number, passbook
            number — whatever the document's own identifier is. Optional
            because not every document type carries one.
        execution_date: Date the document was executed/issued. Optional
            for the same reason.
        survey_number: Survey number as written in this document, which
            may differ from the parcel's current survey_no (resurveys and
            subdivisions mean an older deed can cite a superseded number).
            Optional: not every document states it legibly.
        extent_raw: The extent exactly as printed in the document, e.g.
            "0 Ac 12 Guntas". Kept verbatim as the audit trail behind
            extent_sq_yards. Optional: not every document type states an
            extent at all.
        extent_sq_yards: extent_raw normalised to square yards for
            cross-document comparison. Optional because it is derived from
            extent_raw — when that text is missing or its units cannot be
            parsed with confidence, there is nothing reliable to normalise,
            and a required float would pressure a fabricated guess instead.
        boundaries: The chatur seema, when the document states one.
            Optional because non-deed documents (EC, passbook) typically
            don't carry it.
        executants: Party names on the transferring side of a deed.
            Empty for non-deed documents (EC, passbook).
        claimants: Party names on the receiving side of a deed.
        extraction_confidence: How reliably this was read. Scanned and
            handwritten records make extraction uncertainty the central
            fact about this agent's output (principle 4).
