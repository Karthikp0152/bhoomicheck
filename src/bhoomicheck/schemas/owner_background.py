        is_poa_sale: Whether the transaction is being conducted via a
            Power of Attorney rather than a direct sale by the recorded
            titleholder. This alone is a known risk pattern: *Suraj Lamp
            & Industries v. State of Haryana* (Supreme Court, 2011) held
            that GPA/Agreement-to-Sell/Will transactions do not validly
            transfer title -- only a registered sale deed does.

            matching poa_document_no was found on IGRS. An unregistered
            or unfindable POA is a strong fraud signal, not just a

            matches the name(s) appearing in IGRS's registered document
            chain for this property. A mismatch is a serious red flag
            (possible impersonation), separate from whether a POA is
