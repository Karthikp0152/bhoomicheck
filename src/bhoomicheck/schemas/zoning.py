"""Zoning schemas: raw master-plan extract and the Zoning Agent's report.

KudaMasterPlanExtract was originally defined in adapters/kuda.py, but
ZoningReport needs to embed it, and schemas should never depend on
adapters (the reverse is already true -- e.g. KudaMasterPlanAdapter
imports ParcelIdentifier from here). Moving it here mirrors
schemas/document.py and schemas/litigation.py, which do the same for the
same reason.

    """Raw fields expected off a zoomed-in 1acre.in master-plan screenshot.

    PROVISIONAL -- see adapters/kuda.py module docstring. Every field is
    optional because we don't yet know which of these are actually
    legible on a screenshot; nobody has supplied a real sample yet.

    One screenshot of the KUDA Master Plan 2041 serves two different
    agents: ZoningAgent reads the risk-framed fields (does a road cut
    through *this* parcel, forcing a setback), while GrowthPotentialAgent
    reads the opportunity-framed fields below (is a major upgrade nearby
    without directly affecting the parcel) -- the map's own legend
    ("Growth Corridor 1/2", "Village Expansion Zone", "Approved Layouts")
    is what grounds those fields, not a second lookup on a second source.

    Attributes:
        zoning_classification: e.g. "residential", "commercial" -- exact
            vocabulary 1acre/KUDA uses is unconfirmed, so this stays free
            text rather than a Literal for now.
        road_widening_affects_parcel: Whether a master-plan road passes
            through or borders the parcel, forcing a setback surrender --
            this is the central risk from CLAUDE.md's problem statement.
        setback_required_meters: Width of land the owner would have to
            surrender, if visible/labeled on the map.
        within_ftl_buffer: Whether the parcel falls inside a lake Full
            Tank Level buffer zone.
        in_growth_corridor: Whether the parcel falls inside a "Growth
            Corridor 1/2" or "Village Expansion Zone" area per the map's
            legend -- an opportunity signal, not a risk one.
        near_major_road_upgrade: Whether a proposed Outer Ring Road /
            Arterial Road widening passes near (but not through) the
            parcel -- nearby infrastructure investment without the
            setback risk road_widening_affects_parcel already captures.
        near_approved_layout: Whether the parcel is near an area the map
            marks as an "Approved Layout" -- a proxy for nearby
            development activity/demand.
        notes: Anything else visible that doesn't fit a structured field.
